# Tools I Use A Lot

I will write a bit about tools I use as I remember

## Z

Originally [rupa/z](https://github.com/rupa/z) but I have switched to
[zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)

I have generally bad memory so to cd into a commonly used directory with just
a part of the name I remember is really useful.

## FZF

Fzf is fuzzy finder that is really versatil. You can use it in many places and
hence, for a long time I didn't not understand where and how to use it.

Treats me well for not reading the docs! It has integrations for popular shell
environments that will put
[ctrl+r](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#key-bindings-for-command-line)
on steroids!

Also zoxide picks up fzf and works with it!

## Ripgrep (rg)

A very fast Grep with nice default behaviour including filters.

See why you may want to try [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep?tab=readme-ov-file#why-should-i-use-ripgrep)

## Zellij

I use this mainly behind corporate barbed wires. I initially tried it because
it was a tmux like thing which I can take behid the barbed wires. Something
I really like about [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) is how
discoverable it's features are.

## za

My own shell script to go back up the path.

Find za [here](https://gist.github.com/chanux/1119556). For Fish shell, za.fish
is [here](https://gist.github.com/chanux/9411092)

Another idea I have explored is going up to directory by name. bash/zsh/fish
implementations are found
[here](https://gist.github.com/chanux/08c6f53472190a02b33bd49100163d93)

## Mailhog

Testing emails from a web app you are building? Start
[here](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog)

I really liked Mailhog when I did this type of work but it's been a while since
I had test sending e-mail. Mailhog is not maintained anymore and
[Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) seems to want to carry the baton!

There's also [MailCrab](https://github.com/tweedegolf/mailcrab), written in Rust!

## Vegeta

Want to load test your web app? [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta) is
easy to get started with.
