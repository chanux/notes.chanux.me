# Terrafrom - Tips

## Using multiple Terraform versions

With Terraform 0.11 to 0.12 changes, it's especially important to be able to
easily switch between different Terraform versions.
[TFSwitch](https://warrensbox.github.io/terraform-switcher/) allows easily
managing and switching between different Terraform versions.

``` bash tab="curl"
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/warrensbox/terraform-switcher/release/install.sh | bash
```

``` bash tab="brew"
brew install warrensbox/tap/tfswitch 
```
