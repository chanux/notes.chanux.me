# Notes

I aim to take notes and document stuff I deem worthy from my learning process.

---

This site uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with
[mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme and how
to run it locall is found in [meta doc](meta.md)

What you are seeing though comes to life through a write - commit - push
process. The rest is automated. Learn about that on my
[blog](https://chanux.me/blog/post/automate-static-site-publishing-on-gcp/).
